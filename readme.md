Little Data Big Impacts

Each person on average creates 320 mb of data per day and constantly increasing. Do you get value from your data or does everyone else get greater value than you? Are you being fairly compensated for your data? You can now establish new terms of sharing your data by using a ‘smart contract’. The contract will determine the compensation for your data while maintaining security and privacy

Target market: Initally UK Fitness market which is approximately £5 billion per year.

The majority of adults in the UK are overweight or obese according to national health surveys, yet research suggests we are a country in denial about our weight, we plan to change this through incentive and influencers.

Monetisation is from taking a 5% of the data payments.

Key application components:
1) Identity : unique ID per user (address / unique username)
2) Security : Storing Hashed data on the block chain
3) Control: Your data is visible to you and you can control which companies can see it.
4) Sharing : You have the power to share based on incentive

High level flow
1) Company stakes starting balance to their account
2) User enters their username in the Littledata Dapp.
3) User click subscribe on the data they want to share by default, option to enable specifc companies
4) Dapp receives public key from company via API
5) Dapp encrypts data with Company public key
6) Dapp puts encrypted data on to the blockchain (the future version will encrypt the link only to the encrypted file off chain in the cloud and the data will be deleted after the end of the contract time)
7) Company gets encrypted data from the blockchain
8) Company decrypts data using private key
9) User gets EOS from company from their stake balance (future version will use a multisig wallet with a time limit to ensure payment)
10) Company and User post a Steemit review
